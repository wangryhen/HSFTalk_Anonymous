Given an identity source, <strong>EDTalk</strong> synthesizes talking face videos characterized by mouth shapes, head poses, and expressions consistent with mouth GT, pose source and expression source. These facial dynamics can also be inferred directly from driven audio. Importantly, <strong>EDTalk</strong> demonstrates superior efficiency in disentanglement training compared to other methods.



## TODO
- [x] **Release Arxiv paper.**
- [ ] **Release code. (Once the paper is accepted)**
- [ ] **Release Pre-trained Model. (Once the paper is accepted)**
